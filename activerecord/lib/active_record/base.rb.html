module ActiveRecord #:nodoc:
  # = Active Record
  #
  # Active Record objects don't specify their attributes directly, but rather infer them from
  # the table definition with which they're linked. Adding, removing, and changing attributes
  # and their type is done directly in the database. Any change is instantly reflected in the
  # Active Record objects. The mapping that binds a given Active Record class to a certain
  # database table will happen automatically in most common cases, but can be overwritten for the uncommon ones.
  #
  # See the mapping rules in table_name and the full example in link:files/activerecord/README_rdoc.html for more insight.
  #
  # == Creation
  #
  # Active Records accept constructor parameters either in a hash or as a block. The hash
  # method is especially useful when you're receiving the data from somewhere else, like an
  # HTTP request. It works like this:
  #
  #   user = User.new(name: "David", occupation: "Code Artist")
  #   user.name # =&gt; "David"
  #
  # You can also use block initialization:
  #
  #   user = User.new do |u|
  #     u.name = "David"
  #     u.occupation = "Code Artist"
  #   end
  #
  # And of course you can just create a bare object and specify the attributes after the fact:
  #
  #   user = User.new
  #   user.name = "David"
  #   user.occupation = "Code Artist"
  #
  # == Conditions
  #
  # Conditions can either be specified as a string, array, or hash representing the WHERE-part of an SQL statement.
  # The array form is to be used when the condition input is tainted and requires sanitization. The string form can
  # be used for statements that don't involve tainted data. The hash form works much like the array form, except
  # only equality and range is possible. Examples:
  #
  #   class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     def self.authenticate_unsafely(user_name, password)
  #       where("user_name = '#{user_name}' AND password = '#{password}'").first
  #     end
  #
  #     def self.authenticate_safely(user_name, password)
  #       where("user_name = ? AND password = ?", user_name, password).first
  #     end
  #
  #     def self.authenticate_safely_simply(user_name, password)
  #       where(user_name: user_name, password: password).first
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The &lt;tt&gt;authenticate_unsafely&lt;/tt&gt; method inserts the parameters directly into the query
  # and is thus susceptible to SQL-injection attacks if the &lt;tt&gt;user_name&lt;/tt&gt; and +password+
  # parameters come directly from an HTTP request. The &lt;tt&gt;authenticate_safely&lt;/tt&gt; and
  # &lt;tt&gt;authenticate_safely_simply&lt;/tt&gt; both will sanitize the &lt;tt&gt;user_name&lt;/tt&gt; and +password+
  # before inserting them in the query, which will ensure that an attacker can't escape the
  # query and fake the login (or worse).
  #
  # When using multiple parameters in the conditions, it can easily become hard to read exactly
  # what the fourth or fifth question mark is supposed to represent. In those cases, you can
  # resort to named bind variables instead. That's done by replacing the question marks with
  # symbols and supplying a hash with values for the matching symbol keys:
  #
  #   Company.where(
  #     "id = :id AND name = :name AND division = :division AND created_at &gt; :accounting_date",
  #     { id: 3, name: "37signals", division: "First", accounting_date: '2005-01-01' }
  #   ).first
  #
  # Similarly, a simple hash without a statement will generate conditions based on equality with the SQL AND
  # operator. For instance:
  #
  #   Student.where(first_name: "Harvey", status: 1)
  #   Student.where(params[:student])
  #
  # A range may be used in the hash to use the SQL BETWEEN operator:
  #
  #   Student.where(grade: 9..12)
  #
  # An array may be used in the hash to use the SQL IN operator:
  #
  #   Student.where(grade: [9,11,12])
  #
  # When joining tables, nested hashes or keys written in the form 'table_name.column_name'
  # can be used to qualify the table name of a particular condition. For instance:
  #
  #   Student.joins(:schools).where(schools: { category: 'public' })
  #   Student.joins(:schools).where('schools.category' =&gt; 'public' )
  #
  # == Overwriting default accessors
  #
  # All column values are automatically available through basic accessors on the Active Record
  # object, but sometimes you want to specialize this behavior. This can be done by overwriting
  # the default accessors (using the same name as the attribute) and calling
  # +super+ to actually change things.
  #
  #   class Song &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     # Uses an integer of seconds to hold the length of the song
  #
  #     def length=(minutes)
  #       super(minutes.to_i * 60)
  #     end
  #
  #     def length
  #       super / 60
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # == Attribute query methods
  #
  # In addition to the basic accessors, query methods are also automatically available on the Active Record object.
  # Query methods allow you to test whether an attribute value is present.
  # Additionally, when dealing with numeric values, a query method will return false if the value is zero.
  #
  # For example, an Active Record User with the &lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt; attribute has a &lt;tt&gt;name?&lt;/tt&gt; method that you can call
  # to determine whether the user has a name:
  #
  #   user = User.new(name: "David")
  #   user.name? # =&gt; true
  #
  #   anonymous = User.new(name: "")
  #   anonymous.name? # =&gt; false
  #
  # == Accessing attributes before they have been typecasted
  #
  # Sometimes you want to be able to read the raw attribute data without having the column-determined
  # typecast run its course first. That can be done by using the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;attribute&gt;_before_type_cast&lt;/tt&gt;
  # accessors that all attributes have. For example, if your Account model has a &lt;tt&gt;balance&lt;/tt&gt; attribute,
  # you can call &lt;tt&gt;account.balance_before_type_cast&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;account.id_before_type_cast&lt;/tt&gt;.
  #
  # This is especially useful in validation situations where the user might supply a string for an
  # integer field and you want to display the original string back in an error message. Accessing the
  # attribute normally would typecast the string to 0, which isn't what you want.
  #
  # == Dynamic attribute-based finders
  #
  # Dynamic attribute-based finders are a mildly deprecated way of getting (and/or creating) objects
  # by simple queries without turning to SQL. They work by appending the name of an attribute
  # to &lt;tt&gt;find_by_&lt;/tt&gt; like &lt;tt&gt;Person.find_by_user_name&lt;/tt&gt;.
  # Instead of writing &lt;tt&gt;Person.find_by(user_name: user_name)&lt;/tt&gt;, you can use
  # &lt;tt&gt;Person.find_by_user_name(user_name)&lt;/tt&gt;.
  #
  # It's possible to add an exclamation point (!) on the end of the dynamic finders to get them to raise an
  # ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound error if they do not return any records,
  # like &lt;tt&gt;Person.find_by_last_name!&lt;/tt&gt;.
  #
  # It's also possible to use multiple attributes in the same &lt;tt&gt;find_by_&lt;/tt&gt; by separating them with
  # "_and_".
  #
  #  Person.find_by(user_name: user_name, password: password)
  #  Person.find_by_user_name_and_password(user_name, password) # with dynamic finder
  #
  # It's even possible to call these dynamic finder methods on relations and named scopes.
  #
  #   Payment.order("created_on").find_by_amount(50)
  #
  # == Saving arrays, hashes, and other non-mappable objects in text columns
  #
  # Active Record can serialize any object in text columns using YAML. To do so, you must
  # specify this with a call to the class method
  # {serialize}[rdoc-ref:AttributeMethods::Serialization::ClassMethods#serialize].
  # This makes it possible to store arrays, hashes, and other non-mappable objects without doing
  # any additional work.
  #
  #   class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     serialize :preferences
  #   end
  #
  #   user = User.create(preferences: { "background" =&gt; "black", "display" =&gt; large })
  #   User.find(user.id).preferences # =&gt; { "background" =&gt; "black", "display" =&gt; large }
  #
  # You can also specify a class option as the second parameter that'll raise an exception
  # if a serialized object is retrieved as a descendant of a class not in the hierarchy.
  #
  #   class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     serialize :preferences, Hash
  #   end
  #
  #   user = User.create(preferences: %w( one two three ))
  #   User.find(user.id).preferences    # raises SerializationTypeMismatch
  #
  # When you specify a class option, the default value for that attribute will be a new
  # instance of that class.
  #
  #   class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     serialize :preferences, OpenStruct
  #   end
  #
  #   user = User.new
  #   user.preferences.theme_color = "red"
  #
  #
  # == Single table inheritance
  #
  # Active Record allows inheritance by storing the name of the class in a
  # column that is named "type" by default. See ActiveRecord::Inheritance for
  # more details.
  #
  # == Connection to multiple databases in different models
  #
  # Connections are usually created through
  # {ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionHandling#establish_connection] and retrieved
  # by ActiveRecord::Base.connection. All classes inheriting from ActiveRecord::Base will use this
  # connection. But you can also set a class-specific connection. For example, if Course is an
  # ActiveRecord::Base, but resides in a different database, you can just say &lt;tt&gt;Course.establish_connection&lt;/tt&gt;
  # and Course and all of its subclasses will use this connection instead.
  #
  # This feature is implemented by keeping a connection pool in ActiveRecord::Base that is
  # a hash indexed by the class. If a connection is requested, the
  # {ActiveRecord::Base.retrieve_connection}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionHandling#retrieve_connection] method
  # will go up the class-hierarchy until a connection is found in the connection pool.
  #
  # == Exceptions
  #
  # * ActiveRecordError - Generic error class and superclass of all other errors raised by Active Record.
  # * AdapterNotSpecified - The configuration hash used in
  #   {ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionHandling#establish_connection]
  #   didn't include an &lt;tt&gt;:adapter&lt;/tt&gt; key.
  # * AdapterNotFound - The &lt;tt&gt;:adapter&lt;/tt&gt; key used in
  #   {ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionHandling#establish_connection]
  #   specified a non-existent adapter
  #   (or a bad spelling of an existing one).
  # * AssociationTypeMismatch - The object assigned to the association wasn't of the type
  #   specified in the association definition.
  # * AttributeAssignmentError - An error occurred while doing a mass assignment through the
  #   {ActiveRecord::Base#attributes=}[rdoc-ref:AttributeAssignment#attributes=] method.
  #   You can inspect the +attribute+ property of the exception object to determine which attribute
  #   triggered the error.
  # * ConnectionNotEstablished - No connection has been established.
  #   Use {ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionHandling#establish_connection] before querying.
  # * MultiparameterAssignmentErrors - Collection of errors that occurred during a mass assignment using the
  #   {ActiveRecord::Base#attributes=}[rdoc-ref:AttributeAssignment#attributes=] method.
  #   The +errors+ property of this exception contains an array of
  #   AttributeAssignmentError
  #   objects that should be inspected to determine which attributes triggered the errors.
  # * RecordInvalid - raised by {ActiveRecord::Base#save!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save!] and
  #   {ActiveRecord::Base.create!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence::ClassMethods#create!]
  #   when the record is invalid.
  # * RecordNotFound - No record responded to the {ActiveRecord::Base.find}[rdoc-ref:FinderMethods#find] method.
  #   Either the row with the given ID doesn't exist or the row didn't meet the additional restrictions.
  #   Some {ActiveRecord::Base.find}[rdoc-ref:FinderMethods#find] calls do not raise this exception to signal
  #   nothing was found, please check its documentation for further details.
  # * SerializationTypeMismatch - The serialized object wasn't of the class specified as the second parameter.
  # * StatementInvalid - The database server rejected the SQL statement. The precise error is added in the message.
  #
  # *Note*: The attributes listed are class-level attributes (accessible from both the class and instance level).
  # So it's possible to assign a logger to the class through &lt;tt&gt;Base.logger=&lt;/tt&gt; which will then be used by all
  # instances in the current object space.
